# OVERVIEW  
this is a standard website to be deployed as github.io pages. the github organization name is Ak'sara (its meaning is that good application is created from code/source code that is composed by character).

I want to encourage sponsors and contributors to join this project to contribute to "Advancing Indonesia Digital Literacy"  

## my Insight  
Bad economics climate in all over the world cause higher rate of unemployment, Country like Indonesia need to be more self reliant, to strengthen its currency. Goverment, Industries and the people need to adapt and being facilitate to have at least in cheap software availability.

# PURPOSE  
- to Introduce this initiatives, and calling for sponsorship
- to attract indonesian man power to join the cause
- I need to publish html proposal page and downloadable pdf proposal (that I will create using marpit)  

# PROJECTS
## Aksara IS  
a svelte project to create nocode application, from here enduser can make any application for their company.

## Personal AI assistant  
tauri project to create personal assistant running offline in enduser computing.

## MerdekaOS  
an Arch based linux distribution, which is not bloated, suitable for typical office worker and developer.

# TARGET SPONSOR  
## LAPTOP MANUFACTURER  
- Available Indonesia brand: Advan, Polytron, Axioo  
- Current Manufacturer only sell their brand bundled with Windows (and effecting price for end customer)   
- Market demand for Microsoft product is very high, but product diversity might boost their sales
- Personal AI Assistant will be bundled to merdekaOS which may help indonesian market sentiment(probably too much relying on Indonesian nationalism spirit)

## IT Company  
Microsoft, Oracle, Google, AWS (international companies), Jatis, Remala Abadi, Metrodata (Local companies). Might also interest in development of linux distro and cheap but advanced information system that is developed by their markets (Indonesia: our organization).

Any other companies might also interesting to our cause, or need to partnering with us as an external Research and Development in their company.
